I am supposed to build a brief summary of the job/internship/etc. that I am considering. At this point I am not really considering anything. I have no idea which graduate school I would like to go to, and internship season is still a month or two out (I have a few prospects, but I'm unsure about which one to pursue). I will thus make a very general resume. My hope is that eventually this will be useful, but probably most of the information will have to change/evolve into something better.

This resume represents my best effort to do build such a resume in spite of both lack of experience and lack of direction.
