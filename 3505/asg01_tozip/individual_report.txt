My name: Alex Clemmer
Team Name: Godzillasaurus Rex

Landon is great. A lot of people were really lazy in 2420 and 3500, but Landon is not. Not when other people are responsible, anyway. I like him because he always brings some expertise I was not aware of to the table. I would like to work with him in the future, and would recommend him to other motivated teams.

Alex: 2 - average
Landon: 2 - average, and maybe a bit more than me because he knows more about the subject
