\paragraph{ISA and compiler} determine instruction count for a given program.

\paragraph{Where/how hazards occur:} In a pipelined process, instructions and data tend to move left to right through the stages of execution. That is, an instruction is fetched, then decoded, and so on, moving to the right until completion.

When this is not the case -- for example, when we writeback, we are in the WB stage, and we send back the data into the register file, which is in the ID stage -- is where we get hazards.

There are, in this model, two cases where this happens: once for writebacks, and once for instruction selection ($\textit{i.e.}$, when we decide whether to branch, jump, or just increment).

\paragraph{Reading and writing registers in one cycle:} The book first makes a "logical" distinction between registers written to during WB and registers read from during ID. This is why they shade only half the boxes in the pipelining diagrams. But further, the registers are assumed to be written in the first half of the cycle and read during the second half.

\paragraph{What I-Mem really is:} Instruction memory, or I-Mem is really just the memory that holds the loaded instructions from some program. Since the instructions are literally specified by the program, we can just load them into I-Mem.

\paragraph{WB has no pipeline register: } This would be redundant. Every stage of the pipeline should update the state of the processor, and the pipeline registers are there simply to hold this state. Since writing to the register during WB tracks the state anyway, there's no real point in having a pipeline register also.

\paragraph{The PC is basically a pipeline register: } The PC can be thought of as a pipeline register that just supplies information to IF -- it just keeps track of the state of the processor at a certain point. Except for one thing: when there is an exception, we discard all the pipeline registers ($\textit{why?}$), where we MUST KEEP the PC.

\paragraph{The relationship between cache size and latency: } Interestingly, cache size is not directly related to latency. Cache size in some ways has an effect on $\textit{when}$ we miss (and thus, when request latency is worst), but the time it takes to get that information is independent of this: we may have to travel across a LAN in addition to seeking on the disk, or we may have to query some other server.

In other words, the architecture of system(s) ends up determining the latency, not the size of the cache.

\paragraph{Why organize caches into a hierarchy: } There are two basic types of locality: spatial and temporal. The highest level cache addresses the fact that access times for the most recent-accessed data should be fast, and the next-highest addresses the fact that most data accessed is accessed in close proximity of other recently-accessed data.

That is, L1 cache is small and fast; data on it is meant to be accessed repeatedly. L2 is larger and almost as fast; it is meant to supply the data in close proximity to the stuff in the L1 cache. In this way, when the hit rate is very high, then the memory in cache appears to be as fast as L1 and as large as L2.

\paragraph{Memory is usually structured in true hierarchies: } In most memory models, if data is in memory level $i$, it is also in level $i+1$, assuming that there is such a level (and there would not be if $i$ is the hard drive.

\section*{Questions}

\paragraph{Writing regs on clock edge} If contents of a register only change on clock edge, how is writing happening in the first half of the cycle, while reading happens the second half? Shouldn't this be reversed?
