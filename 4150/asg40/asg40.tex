\section{}

Assuming we already have the matrix $\delta$, the problem breaks down into one of a few subproblems. Either the end of the two strings matches or it doesn't, just like in the book. In the case that it doesn't match, either string can have a space. Since we don't know which is which, we'll say that it can be any of these three. From there, it's a simple matrix lookup.

\begin{equation}
A(i,j) = \mbox{argmax}_c(\delta(A(i-1,j) + 1, \delta(A(i, j-1), \delta(A(i-1,j-1))
\end{equation}
