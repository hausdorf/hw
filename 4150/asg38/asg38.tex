\section{}

Given some $a_i$, what we want to do is to find some $a_t \in a_i...a_n$ such that the distance between $a_i$ and $a_n$ is as close to 200 as possible. So for example, if we are given $a_3$, our job is to find the $a_t$ that occurs after $a_3$ such that dist($a_t ) - $ dist($a_3$) that is closest to 200.

This gives us a simple recursive relation:

\begin{equation}
H(i) = \mbox{min}(|200-(a_t \in a_i ... a_n) - a_{i-1})|)
\end{equation}

This of course suggests a quick algorithm: examine every element in the range $a_i...a_n$, keeping track of how close the distance between your current element (call it $a_t$) and $a_{i-1}$ (your previous element) are; the instant this distance begins $\textit{growing}$ again, stop---it's not going to get smaller ever again.
