As we can see, the expressions tend to be evaluated correctly. This is because the left-associativity applies to the additive operators (i.e., '-' and '+') first and the multiplicative operators ('*' and '/') second. Because of this, expressions are grouped leftmost according to these operators. That is, 3+4*5 would become (3+4)*5. When the left associativity relates to the multiplicative operators, then this becomes (4*5).
