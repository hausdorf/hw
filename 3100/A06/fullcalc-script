When we respect the left- and right-associativity of the various expressions here, we can rewrite it all as so: (((({a=2} + {b=3}) + (a^(b^a))) - a) - b) - a. So to evaluate, we recurse to the right until the allocation of 'a', which is 2. Then we step up to the addition operator and then step down to the allocation of 'b', which is 3. 2 and 3 is 5. Then we step up to the other addition, and then back down to the exponent. We first evaluate b^a, which is 9. 2^9 is 512. We step back up the tree to the addition, which can now fully evaluate the expression 5+512, which is 517. We step up to the leftmost subtraction. To evalutate this subtraction, we have to step down to evaluate the 'a' on the left, which is 2. 517-2 is 515. We step up to the next subtraction which requires that we step down to get the value of 'b', which is 3. We step back up the the subtraction, which is 515-3, or 512. We step up to the last subtraction, which is the very top level of the parse tree. We step down one last time to get 'a', which is 2, and then step back up to subtract 512-2, which is 510.

2^2^2^2
65536

Exponents are right-associative, so the equation would look like so: 2^(2^(2^2))). So to evaluate the leftmost 2, we have to recurse all the way down the right end of the tree. The rightmost term we can actually evaluate is 2^2, which is 4. 2^4 is 16. Return this to the next level up, and we have 2^16, which is 65,536.. 

8/4/2
1

Division is left-associative, so the equation could be rewritten as follows: (8/4)/2. 8/4 is 2, and 2/2 is 1.

8/4/2/0
Divide by zero
1

Again, division is left associative. 8/4 is 2, 2/2 is 1, and 1/0 is a divides-by-zero.
