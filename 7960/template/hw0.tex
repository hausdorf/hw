% ANY LINE BEGINNING "%" IS A COMMENT.  YOU CAN UNCOMMENT THE BELOW
% TEXT AND FILL IN YOUR OWN.
% \begin{solution}
%   Blah..
% \end{solution}

\i List a few (research/CS/math/whatever) topics that interest you.

% \begin{solution}
%   I am interested in ..

% 
%   Math: 10
% \end{solution}

\i What are your goals in this class?

% \begin{solution}
%   Blah..

\section{Written Problems}

Answer the following questions in 50-100 words each:
\bee
\i What is the difference between supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning?
% \begin{solution}
%   Blah..
% \end{solution}
\i List at least two real-world problems (other than those discussed in class) for each of the categories:
  supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement. For one of the supervised problems, what is the form
  of the output and what might be a reasonably input? For the reinforcement learning problem, what
  might be the state space, action space and reward function?
% \begin{solution}
%   Blah..
% \end{solution}
\i What is overfitting? What is underfitting? How is overfitting controlled?
% \begin{solution}
%   Blah..
% \end{solution}
\i Getting labeled data for supervised learning is expensive. What are some of the 
   approaches to deal with this problem?
% \begin{solution}
%   Blah..

\section{Additional Exercises}


The following are true/false questions.  You don't need to answer the
questions.  Just tell us which ones you can't answer confidently in
less than one minute.  (You won't be graded on this.)  If you can't
answer at least $6$, you should probably spend some extra time outside
of class beefing up on elementary math.  

\bee
\i $\log x + \log y = \log (xy)$
\i $\log [ab^c] = \log a + (\log b) (\log c)$
\i $\ddx [5x^2 + 3x] = 10x + 3$
\i $\ddx \log x = - \frac 1 x$
\i $p(a \| b) = p(a,b) / p(b)$
\i $p(x \| y,z) = p(x \| y) p(x \| z)$
\i $\norm{\al \vec u + \vec v}^2 = \al^2 \norm{\vec u}^2 + \norm{\vec v}^2$, where $\norm{\cdot}$ denotes Euclidean norm, $\al$ is a scalar and $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are vectors
\i $\ab{\vec u\T\vec v} \geq \norm{\vec u} \times \norm{\vec v}$, where $\ab{\cdot}$ denotes absolute value and $\vec u\T\vec v$ is the dot product of $\vec u$ and $\vec v$
\i $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \ud x \exp[-(\pi/2) x^2] = \sqrt{2}$
