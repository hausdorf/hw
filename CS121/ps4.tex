\problem{4+4+4}
Are the following languages context-free? Prove or disprove. \emph{When giving a formal construction, no correctness proof is required: just an explanation.}
\subproblem $L = \{a^n b^m : n < m < 3n \}$
\subproblem $\{a^{n^2} : n \in \Nat\}$ over $\Sigma = \{a\}$
\subproblem $\{a^ib^jc^k : i, j, k \in \Nat, \text{ and if } i = 1 \text{ then } j \ge k\}$ over $\Sigma = \{a,b,c\}$

\problem{6}

Draw the state diagram for a PDA for the language of all strings with
twice as many $a$s as $b$s over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$.  Use the
state diagram notation for PDAs given in Sipser.

\problem{2+8}
\subproblem Give an English language description of the language generated by the following grammar:
$$S \rightarrow aB \mid bA \mid \varepsilon$$
$$A \rightarrow aS \mid bAA$$
$$B \rightarrow bS \mid aBB$$
\subproblem Now, prove that the grammar does indeed produce the language that you describe.

\problem{12}
Unlike the regular languages, the class of context-free languages
is not closed under complement.  In Example 2.38, Sipser proves that
the language $L = \{ww: w\in\{a,b\}^*\}$ is not context-free.  Here,
you get to look at the complement of $L$:

Show that the language $\b L = \b{\{ww: w\in\{a,b\}^*\}}$ is
context-free by giving a grammar that generates it.  In a sentence or two,
justify the correctness of your grammar.

(Hint: argue first that $\b{L}$ is the set of all strings of the form
$xaybz$ or $xbyaz$, where $|x|+|z|=|y|$, along with all strings of odd
length.)

\problem{Challenge!! 3} 
Show that every context-free language over a unary alphabet is regular.
