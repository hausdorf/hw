% PROBLEM 1 - Chomsky Normal Form
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\problem{4 + 4 + 2 + 2}

Let $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ where $V=\{S,V\}$, $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$, and $R$ is the set of rules: 

$$ 
S \rightarrow bSS \| aS \| aV $$
$$ V \rightarrow aVb \| bVa \| VV \| \varepsilon 
$$

\subproblem
Transform $G$ into an equivalent grammar $G'$ in Chomsky normal form.

\subproblem
Verify that the string $abaab$ is generated by $G'$, using the recognition algorithm for grammars in Chomsky normal form given in class.  Show the complete filled-in matrix.

\subproblem
Draw a parse tree for the derviation of $abaab$ from the transformed grammar $G'$.

\subproblem 
In one sentence, what language does $G$ generate?

% PROBLEM 2 - Grammar theory
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\problem{6} 

A left-linear rule of a CFG $(V, \Sigma, R, S)$ is one whose right-hand side is a member of $V\Sigma^*\cup\Sigma^*$, that is, only the leftmost symbol can be a nonterminal. Right-linear rules are defined analogously. Show that a grammar with only left-linear rules, or only right-linear rules, generates a regular language, but a grammar with a mixture of left- and right-linear rules may generate a non-regular language.

\problem{6}
Consider two languages, $L_1$ and $L_2,$ recognized by Turing machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively. Prove there is a Turing machine, $M_{1 + 2}$ which recognizes $L_{1 + 2} = L_1 \cap L_2.$  You may use the multitape Turing Machine model.

% PROBLEM 4 TM equivalence over alphabets

\problem{6 + 2} 
Consider a Turing machine $M$ with a tape alphabet of size $n \geq 2$ deciding a language $L$. 

\subproblem Show how to construct a Turing machine with a two-symbol tape alphabet that decides $L$.

\subproblem Compare your constructed machine's and $M$'s time to halt. That is, if $M$ takes $N$ steps to halt on input $w$, approximately how many steps, as a function of $N$, $n$, and perhaps other parameters of $M$, will your transformed machine take?

% PROBLEM 4 QAs = TMs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\problem{6 + 2}
A queue is similar to a stack, except that instead of pushing and popping on the top of the stack, you enqueue an item on one end of the queue and dequeue it on the other end in a first-in/first-out manner.

A queue automaton (QA) is a deterministic automaton that, in addition to having a finite set of states and transitions, has a queue for data storage. At each step, a QA dequeues the next symbol, and based on that symbol and its current state, transitions to another state and queues any number of symbols . When run on an input string $w$, a QA begins with the string $w\$$ in the queue, where $\$$ is a symbol not in the input alphabet that marks the end of the string. A QA accepts by transitioning to a special accept state. A QA can fail to accept by looping forever or if its queue becomes empty (so that it cannot dequeue a symbol and make any more transitions).

\subproblem
Demonstrate how a Turing machine can be simulated by a QA. You need not prove your construction correct, but it should handle corner cases correctly.

\subproblem
Estimate the number of states in your construction of a QA as a function of the number of states in the TM and the size of its alphabet.
