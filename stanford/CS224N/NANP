NANP appear to be the most important, and easiest parts of a sentence to parse. They are concepts that are literally so important to something, they can be shorthanded with simple NPs. Most of the time they appear to be *too* general -- so general that they *must* specifically refer to something important (e.g. "the ball" in a basketball game, as opposed to "the basketball that people were playing with"). They are probably almost always objects that are very closely associated with some given thing.

Extending this concept, in longer texts, can we derive these "important" NPs by whether they are too general? And what defines that? Can we use these important NPs as a way to compare how similar articles are?
