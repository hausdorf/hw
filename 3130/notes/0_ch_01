Is everything determined by randomness?
	- Who knows? But scientists use tools of probability and statistics all the time.

1.1 BIOMETRY
	- The science (art?) of identifying a person based on biological characteristics, e.g., fingerprints or voice.
	- Recent research indicates that iris recognition can beat all existing biometric systems.
		a. First you get a picture of an iris and convert it into "iris code", which is 2048 bits.
		b. Unfortunately, at different times and places, the iris code of the same person can be different.
			i. This is why the system allows for about 34% mismatches.
			ii. This works because different people have very different irides. Over a large collection of irides, lots of code bits take 0 and 1 about half the time.
