No it cannot. Thread 1 occurrs entirely sequentially with the one exception of \texttt{a}, which encapsulates everything. Since thread 2 doesn't use \texttt{a}, so deadlock is not possible there. In thread 2, \texttt{b} is nested in \texttt{a}, but in thread 1, there is no other nesting, so it impossible for both threads to just wait for the other to release the lock.
